# password-manager
# An app which can help manage your password details for all you accounts on the internet

Having issues with thinking of a new password while signing up a new account? Sometimes it could be quite tricky to decide 
what a strong password should be, and you might have troubles remembering every single password for all your online accounts.
This password manager application can make your life easier. By simply typing the name of the account you own, e.g Facebook, and
put your password there, this app can store those account credentials by writing into a JSON file. The most powerful thing is you can even 
generate a random but strong password automatically, and you do not have to remember it! By typing your account name and clicking search, 
there you go! Your password manager would pick it up for you. So, next time you do not need to use any of the forget password to reset it.


The GUI elements including window widget, canvas widget, entry widgets, image, labels and buttons of the app are built by using the tkinter module.
